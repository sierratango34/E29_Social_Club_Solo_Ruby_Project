# E29 Social Club

[Launch the app on Heroku](https://e29-social-club.herokuapp.com)

This is the first full-stack web application developed 4 weeks into CodeClan's 16-week [Professional Software Development](https://codeclan.com/courses/professional-software-development/) course.

## Overview

It is a booking system used by the Social Club Organiser, to add/edit members and events; to book members onto events; and to keep track of all bookings.

## Original Gym Brief

"A local gym has asked you to build a piece of software to help them to manage memberships, and register members for classes."

### MVP

- The app should allow the gym to create / edit / delete members
- The app should allow the gym to create / edit / delete classes
- The app should allow the gym to add members to specific classes
- The app should show a list of all upcoming classes
- The app should show all members that are registered for a particular class

## My Personal Spin on the Brief

I decided to theme my app on a 'Social Club' rather than a Gym, to reflect my assumed role as principal organiser of Cohort E29's social events throughout the course. Whilst the app still referred to _'members'_ - the 'classes' were changed to _'events'_.
